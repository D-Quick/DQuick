DQuick
======

A GUI library written in D.

You may want take a look at D programming language official web site : dlang.org
and to the framework that inspired us (QtQuick) :

We are using Lua as scripting language instead of javascript, cause there is no C javascript engine. And a non JIT
interpreter is prefered for some platforms (iOS).

Take a look to the DQuick.pptx for more details.
